Here we'll show you how to do this on colab where we use its facility for storing secrets. If you're using you need to find an appropriate way to store your API keys securely. My recommendation is to use environment variables. *Never hardcode your API keys in your code*, share them publicly, or commit them to version control. People create bots that scan public repos for API keys to exploit them."

            "\n",
            "* **Wild Animal Behavior:** Woodchucks are wild animals.  They retain strong instincts to burrow, forage, and defend their territory.  This means they're unlikely to be cuddly or easily trained like a domesticated animal. Expect digging, chewing, and potentially aggressive behavior if they feel threatened.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Extensive Housing Requirements:**  A suitable enclosure for a woodchuck is far larger than a typical pet cage. You'd need a sizable, secure outdoor enclosure with plenty of space for digging, climbing, and hiding.  This requires significant space, time, and money to build and maintain.  Escape-proofing is paramount.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Specialized Diet:**  Feeding a woodchuck correctly requires research and commitment. Their diet consists of grasses, plants, fruits, and vegetables – not standard pet store food. Providing a balanced diet and ensuring access to fresh water is crucial.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Veterinary Care:** Finding a veterinarian experienced with woodchucks can be challenging.  Treatment costs can be high, and illness in a wild animal can be difficult to diagnose and treat.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Legal Restrictions:**  Keeping wild animals as pets is often restricted by local laws and regulations.  You may need permits or licenses, and it's important to comply with all applicable regulations.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Disease Risk:**  Woodchucks can carry diseases, such as Lyme disease, that can be transmitted to humans.  Proper hygiene and sanitation are essential, but risk remains.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Smell:**  Woodchucks, especially males, can have a strong musky odor.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Destructive Behavior:**  Their natural instinct to dig and chew can cause significant damage to your property if not contained properly.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Limited Interaction:**  Unlike dogs or cats, you'll likely have limited opportunities for genuine interaction and bonding with a woodchuck.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Ethical Considerations:**  Some people argue against keeping wild animals as pets, believing it's unnatural and potentially harmful to their well-being.  Removing them from their natural habitat can negatively impact their overall health and longevity.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, while the novelty might be appealing, the responsibilities and challenges of keeping a woodchuck as a pet far outweigh the potential rewards for most people.  It's generally recommended to appreciate these animals in their natural habitat rather than attempting to domesticate them.\n",
