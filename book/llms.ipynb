    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are a type of deep learning model that are trained on massive amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. They are based on transformer architectures, which allow them to capture long-range dependencies in text. LLMs can perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. Examples of LLMs include OpenAI's GPT series, Google's Gemini, XAI's Grok, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama. These models have revolutionized the field of NLP and have numerous applications in various industries, including customer service, content creation, and healthcare."
